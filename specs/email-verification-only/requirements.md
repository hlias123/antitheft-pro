# Requirements Document - Email Verification Only System

## Introduction

This specification defines a simplified authentication system that focuses solely on email verification for new account creation. The system will send verification codes to users' email addresses when they create new accounts, ensuring email ownership before account activation.

## Glossary

- **System**: The Secure Guardian Pro authentication system
- **User**: A person attempting to create or access an account
- **Verification_Code**: A 4-6 digit numeric code sent via email
- **Email_Service**: The backend service responsible for sending emails
- **Account**: A user profile stored in the system database

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Account Registration

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account using only my email and password, so that I can access the security system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides name, email, and password, THE System SHALL validate the input format
2. WHEN the email format is valid, THE System SHALL check if the email already exists
3. IF the email already exists, THEN THE System SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN all validation passes, THE System SHALL create a pending account record
5. THE System SHALL generate a random verification code between 1000-9999

### Requirement 2: Email Verification Code Delivery

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to receive a verification code in my email, so that I can confirm my email ownership.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an account is created, THE System SHALL send a verification email to the provided address
2. THE Email_Service SHALL include the verification code in a formatted email template
3. THE System SHALL support multilingual email templates (Arabic, English, Greek)
4. WHEN email sending fails, THE System SHALL provide fallback test codes for development
5. THE System SHALL log email delivery status for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3: Code Verification Process

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to enter the verification code I received, so that I can activate my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a verification code, THE System SHALL validate the code format (4 digits)
2. THE System SHALL check if the code matches the stored verification code
3. WHEN the code is correct, THE System SHALL activate the user account
4. WHEN the code is incorrect, THE System SHALL display an error message
5. THE System SHALL allow code resending with a new random code

### Requirement 4: Account Activation

**User Story:** As a verified user, I want my account to be automatically activated after successful verification, so that I can immediately access the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification succeeds, THE System SHALL mark the account as verified
2. THE System SHALL generate an authentication token for the user
3. THE System SHALL redirect the user to the main dashboard
4. THE System SHALL display a success message in the user's preferred language
5. THE System SHALL store the user session for future access

### Requirement 5: Multilingual Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want the verification process to work in my preferred language (Arabic, English, or Greek), so that I can understand all messages and instructions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL support Arabic (RTL), English (LTR), and Greek (LTR) languages
2. WHEN a user selects a language, THE System SHALL update all UI elements accordingly
3. THE System SHALL send email templates in the user's selected language
4. THE System SHALL maintain language preference throughout the verification process
5. THE System SHALL provide translated error and success messages

### Requirement 6: Security and Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the verification process to be secure and prevent abuse, so that only legitimate users can create accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL enforce strong password requirements (minimum 8 characters)
2. THE System SHALL validate email format using standard regex patterns
3. THE System SHALL expire verification codes after 10 minutes
4. THE System SHALL prevent multiple verification attempts with rate limiting
5. THE System SHALL hash and securely store user passwords

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when something goes wrong during verification, so that I know how to resolve the issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email sending fails, THE System SHALL inform the user and provide alternatives
2. WHEN verification code expires, THE System SHALL offer to resend a new code
3. WHEN network errors occur, THE System SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. THE System SHALL provide helpful instructions for common issues
5. THE System SHALL log errors for system administrators to review

### Requirement 8: Development and Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want testing capabilities that work without real email sending, so that I can develop and test the system efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL provide test verification codes (1234, 0000, 9999) that always work
2. WHEN email service is unavailable, THE System SHALL log codes to console for testing
3. THE System SHALL support environment-specific configuration for email services
4. THE System SHALL provide clear documentation for setup and testing
5. THE System SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing user data
