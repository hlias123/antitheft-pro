# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing the login-to-dashboard access issue in the Secure Guardian Pro application. Users are currently unable to access the main dashboard interface after successful login, preventing them from using the core application features.

## Glossary

- **Login System**: The authentication mechanism that validates user credentials
- **Dashboard Interface**: The main application interface showing security features after login
- **Authentication Token**: JWT token used to maintain user session
- **User Session**: The authenticated state maintained after successful login

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a verified user, I want to successfully access the main dashboard after login, so that I can use the security monitoring features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verified user enters correct credentials, THE Login System SHALL authenticate the user successfully
2. WHEN authentication is successful, THE Login System SHALL store the authentication token locally
3. WHEN the token is stored, THE Login System SHALL redirect the user to the Dashboard Interface
4. WHEN the Dashboard Interface loads, THE Login System SHALL display user information correctly
5. WHEN the dashboard is active, THE Login System SHALL initialize all security features

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user with login issues, I want clear error messages and debugging information, so that I can understand what went wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN login fails, THE Login System SHALL display specific error messages in both Arabic and English
2. WHEN authentication errors occur, THE Login System SHALL log detailed error information to console
3. WHEN network issues occur, THE Login System SHALL show appropriate connection error messages
4. WHEN the dashboard fails to load, THE Login System SHALL provide fallback error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and debugging capabilities, so that I can identify and fix login issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any authentication step fails, THE Login System SHALL log detailed debugging information
2. WHEN API calls are made, THE Login System SHALL log request and response data
3. WHEN dashboard initialization fails, THE Login System SHALL provide error details
4. WHEN user session is invalid, THE Login System SHALL handle token refresh or re-authentication
